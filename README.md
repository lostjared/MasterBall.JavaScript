Master Ball is a classic breakout-style game implemented using HTML5 and 
JavaScript. The game features a ball that bounces off walls and a paddle that the player controls to prevent the ball from falling off the screen. The objective is to clear all the blocks on the screen by hitting them with the ball.

## Gameplay

- The ball will bounce off the walls, paddle, and blocks.
- When the ball hits a block, the block is destroyed and the player scores points.
